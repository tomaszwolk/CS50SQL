-- Your team is going to need a great home run hitter. Ken Griffey Jr., a long-time Silver Slugger and Gold Glove award winner, might be a good prospect.
-- In 3.sql, write a SQL query to find Ken Griffey Jr.’s home run history.
--      * Sort by year in descending order.
--      * Note that there may be two players with the name “Ken Griffey.” This Ken Griffey was born in 1969.
--      * Your query should return a table with two columns, one for year and one for home runs.

SELECT "year", "HR" FROM "performances" WHERE "player_id" = (
    SELECT "id" FROM "players"
    WHERE "first_name" = 'Ken' AND "last_name" = 'Griffey' AND "birth_year" = 1969
) ORDER BY "year" DESC;
