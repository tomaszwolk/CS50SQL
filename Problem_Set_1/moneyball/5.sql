-- Itâ€™s a bit of a slow day in the office. Though Satchel no longer plays, in 5.sql,
-- write a SQL query to find all teams that Satchel Paige played for.
--      * Your query should return a table with a single column, one for the name of the teams.

SELECT DISTINCT("teams"."name") FROM "teams"
JOIN "performances" ON "teams"."id" = "performances"."team_id"
JOIN "players" ON "performances"."player_id" = "players"."id"
WHERE "players"."first_name" LIKE '%Satchel%' AND "players"."last_name" LIKE '%Paige%';
