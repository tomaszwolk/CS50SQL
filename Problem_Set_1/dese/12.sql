-- A parent asks you for advice on finding the best public school districts in Massachusetts.
-- In 12.sql, write a SQL query to find public school districts with above-average per-pupil expenditures
-- and an above-average percentage of teachers rated “exemplary”. Your query should return the districts’ names,
-- along with their per-pupil expenditures and percentage of teachers rated exemplary.
-- Sort the results first by the percentage of teachers rated exemplary (high to low), then by the per-pupil expenditure (high to low).

SELECT "districts"."name", "per_pupil_expenditure", "exemplary" FROM "districts"
JOIN "expenditures" ON "districts"."id" = "expenditures"."district_id"
JOIN "staff_evaluations" ON "districts"."id" = "staff_evaluations"."district_id"
WHERE "per_pupil_expenditure" > (
    SELECT AVG("per_pupil_expenditure") FROM "expenditures"
) AND "exemplary" > (
    SELECT AVG("exemplary") FROM "staff_evaluations"
) AND "districts"."type" = 'Public School District'
ORDER BY "exemplary" DESC, "per_pupil_expenditure" DESC;
