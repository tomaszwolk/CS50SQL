-- Is there a relationship between school expenditures and graduation rates?
-- In 11.sql, write a SQL query to display the names of schools, their per-pupil expenditure, and their graduation rate.
-- Sort the schools from greatest per-pupil expenditure to least. If two schools have the same per-pupil expenditure, sort by school name.
--      * You should assume a school spends the same amount per-pupil their district as a whole spends.
