# Census Taker
## Problem to Solve
You are a census taker working for the Nepali government. As you crest one final hill, your breath catches at the sight of a Himalayan sunrise, casting a glow on the village you’ve journeyed so far to reach. Your guide, a local, halts abruptly. Underneath the steady rustle of your census papers, you feel an itch of curiosity. After all, it’s not every day your job takes you to a village like this one.

In `census.db`, process your data into views the Nepali government can use for record-keeping.

## Schema
In census.db you’ll find a single table, census. In the census table, you’ll find the following columns:

- `id`, which uniquely identifies each census record
- `district`, which is the name of the census record’s district
- `locality`, which is the name of the census record’s locality within the district
- `families`, which is the number of families associated with the census record
- `households`, which is the total number of households associated with the census record (multiple families may live in the same household)
- `population`, which is the population associated with the census record
- `male`, which is the number of people associated with the census record who have identified as male
- `female`, which is the number of people associated with the census record who have identified as female

## Specification
In each of the corresponding `.sql` files, write a SQL statement to create each of the following views of the data in `census.db`. Note that, while views can be created from other views, each of your views should stand alone (i.e., not rely on a prior view).

### Rural
In `rural.sql`, write a SQL statement to create a view named `rural`. This view should contain all census records relating to a rural municipality (identified by including “rural” in their name). Ensure the view contains all of the columns from the `census` table.

### Total
In `total.sql`, write a SQL statement to create a view named `total`. This view should contain the sums for each numeric column in `census`, across all districts and localities. Ensure the view contains each of the following columns:

- `families`, which is the sum of families from every locality in Nepal.
- `households`, which is the sum of households from every locality in Nepal.
- `population`, which is the sum of the population from every locality in Nepal.
- `male`, which is the sum of people identifying as male from every locality in Nepal.
- `female`, which is the sum of people identifying as female from every locality in Nepal.

### By District
In `by_district.sql`, write a SQL statement to create a view named `by_district`. This view should contain the sums for each numeric column in `census`, grouped by `district`. Ensure the view contains each of the following columns:

- `district`, which is the name of the district.
- `families`, which is the total number of families in the district.
- `households`, which is the total number of households in the district.
- `population`, which is the total population of the district.
- `male`, which is the total number of people identifying as male in the district.
- `female`, which is the total number of people identifying as female in the district.

### Most Populated
In `most_populated.sql`, write a SQL statement to create a view named `most_populated`. This view should contain, in order from greatest to least, the most populated districts in Nepal. Ensure the view contains each of the following columns:

- `district`, which is the name of the district.
- `families`, which is the total number of families in the district.
- `households`, which is the total number of households in the district.
- `population`, which is the total population of the district.
- `male`, which is the total number of people identifying as male in the district.
- `female`, which is the total number of people identifying as female in the district.

## Usage
To test your views as you write them in your `.sql` files, you can run a query on the database by running

```sql
.read FILENAME
```

where `FILENAME` is the name of the file containing your SQL query. For example,

```sql
.read rural.sql
```

Keep in mind you can also use

```sql
DROP VIEW name;
```

where `name` is the name of your view, to remove a view before creating it anew.
