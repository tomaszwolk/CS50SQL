# Bed and Breakfast
## Problem to Solve
A Bed and Breakfast (“BnB” for short!) is a short-term place one might stay and pay the owner for the service, similar to a hotel. Over the past few years, AirBnB has allowed most anyone to rent out their place, whether it’s a home, a cute cottage, or even a treehouse.

You’re a data analyst for the City of Boston and you’re interested in discovering how the rise of AirBnB has changed the local tourist scene. You’ve even compiled a database, `bnb.db`, filled with data directly from AirBnB. In `bnb.db`, whip up a few views that will paint a clearer picture of AirBnB’s influence on the city of Boston.

## Schema
![Schema](image.png)

Within `bnb.db`, you’ll find three tables that implement the relationships described in the ER diagram above. Click the drop-downs below to learn more about the schema of each table.

<details>
<summary>listings table</summary>
The `listings` table contains the following columns:

- `id`, which is the ID of the listing.
- `property_type`, which is the type of the listing (e.g., “Entire `rental` unit”, “Private room in rental unit”, etc.).
- `host_name`, which is the AirBnB username of the listing’s host.
- `accommodates`, which is the listing’s maximum number of occupants.
- `bedrooms`, which is the listing’s number of bedrooms.
- `description`, which is the description of the listing on AirBnB.
</details>

<details>
<summary>reviews table</summary>
The `reviews` table contains the following columns:

- `id`, which is the ID of the review.
- `listing_id`, which is the ID of the listing which received the review.
- `date`, which is the date the review was posted.
- `reviewer_name`, which is the AirBnB username of the reviewer.
- `comments`, which is the content of the review.
</details>

<details>
<summary>availabilities table</summary>
The `availabilities` table contains the following columns:

- `id`, which is the id of the availability.
- `listing_id`, which is the listing ID associated with the availability.
- `date`, which is the date of the availability.
- `available`, which is whether the date is still available to be booked (TRUE or FALSE).
- `price`, which is the price of staying on the given date.
</details>

## Specification
In each of the corresponding `.sql` files, write a SQL statement to create each of the following views of the data in `bnb.db`. Note that, while views can be created from other views, each of your views should stand alone (i.e., not rely on a prior view).

### No Descriptions
You might notice that when running
```
SELECT * FROM "listings" LIMIT 5;
```
the results look quite wonky! The `description` column contains descriptions with many line breaks, each of which are printed to your terminal.

In `no_descriptions.sql`, write a SQL statement to create a view named `no_descriptions` that includes all of the columns in the `listings` table except for `description`.

### One-Bedrooms
In `one_bedrooms.sql`, write a SQL statement to create a view named `one_bedrooms`. This view should contain all listings that have exactly one bedroom. Ensure the view contains the following columns:

- `id`, which is the `id` of the listing from the `listings` table.
- `property_type`, from the `listings` table.
- `host_name`, from the `listings` table.
- `accommodates`, from the `listings` table.

### Available
In `available.sql`, write a SQL statement to create a view named `available`. This view should contain all dates that are available at all listings. Ensure the view contains the following columns:

- `id`, which is the `id` of the listing from the `listings` table.
- `property_type`, from the `listings` table.
- `host_name`, from the `listings` table.
- `date`, from the `availabilities` table, which is the date of the availability.

### Frequently Reviewed
In `frequently_reviewed.sql`, write a SQL statement to create a view named `frequently_reviewed`. This view should contain the 100 most frequently reviewed listings, sorted from most- to least-frequently reviewed. Ensure the view contains the following columns:

- `id`, which is the `id` of the listing from the listings table.
- `property_type`, from the `listings` table.
- `host_name`, from the `listings` table.
- `reviews`, which is the number of reviews the listing has received.

If any two listings have the same number of reviews, sort by `property_type` (in alphabetical order), followed by `host_name` (in alphabetical order).

### June Vacancies
In `june_vacancies.sql`, write a SQL statement to create a view named `june_vacancies`. This view should contain all listings and the number of days in June of 2023 that they remained vacant. Ensure the view contains the following columns:

- `id`, which is the `id` of the listing from the `listings` table.
- `property_type`, from the `listings` table.
- `host_name`, from the `listings` table.
- `days_vacant`, which is the number of days in June of 2023, that the given listing was marked as available.

## Usage
To test your views as you write them in your `.sql` files, you can run a query on the database by running
```
.read FILENAME
```
where `FILENAME` is the name of the file containing your SQL query. For example,
```
.read no_descriptions.sql
```
Keep in mind you can also use
```
DROP VIEW name;
````
where name is the name of your view, to remove a view before creating it anew.
