-- The app needs to send users a summary of their engagement.
-- Find the username of the most popular user, defined as the user who has had the most messages sent to them.

-- Ensure your query uses the search_messages_by_to_user_id index, which is defined as follows:

-- CREATE INDEX "search_messages_by_to_user_id"
-- ON "messages"("to_user_id");
SELECT "username" FROM "users"
WHERE "id" = (
    SELECT "to_user_id" FROM "messages"
    GROUP BY "to_user_id"
    ORDER BY COUNT("to_user_id") DESC
);
