-- Your general manager (i.e., the person who makes decisions about player contracts)
-- asks you whether the team should trade a current player for Cal Ripken Jr., a star player who’s likely nearing his retirement.
-- In 2.sql, write a SQL query to find Cal Ripken Jr.’s salary history.
--      * Sort by year in descending order.
--      * Your query should return a table with two columns, one for year and one for salary.

SELECT "year", "salary" FROM "salaries"
WHERE "player_id" = (
    SELECT "id" FROM "players" WHERE "first_name" = 'Cal' AND "last_name" = 'Ripken'
) ORDER BY "year" DESC;
