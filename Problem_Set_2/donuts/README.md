# Union Square Donuts
## Problem to Solve
Around Boston, Brookline, and Somerville, you might catch sight of Union Square Donuts, a shop famous in the area for its delicious confections. Suppose that Union Square Donuts has been around for a while and, while their paper receipts have worked well so far, they‚Äôre hoping for a system to help them handle more customers. In fact, they‚Äôve just hired you to design a database fitting for their shop. In exchange, free donuts? üç©

In a file called `schema.sql` in a folder called `donuts`, write a set of SQL statements to create a database that Union Square Donuts could use to manage their day-to-day operations.

## Specification
Your task at hand is to create a SQLite database for Union Square Donuts from scratch, as by writing a set of `CREATE TABLE` statements in a `schema.sql` file. The implementation details are up to you, though you should minimally ensure that your database meets the team‚Äôs expectations and that it can represent the sample data.

## Expectations
To understand the team‚Äôs expectations for their database, you sat down to talk with them after the shop closed for the day.

### Ingredients
We certainly need to keep track of our ingredients. Some of the typical ingredients we use include flour, yeast, oil, butter, and several different types of sugar. Moreover, we would love to keep track of the price we pay per unit of ingredient (whether it‚Äôs pounds, grams, etc.).

### Donuts
We‚Äôll need to include our selection of donuts, past and present! For each donut on the menu, we‚Äôd love to include three things:

- The name of the donut
- Whether the donut is gluten-free
- The price per donut  

Oh, and it‚Äôs important that we be able to look up the ingredients for each of the donuts!

### Orders
We love to see customers in person, though we realize a good number of people might order online nowadays. We‚Äôd love to be able to keep track of those online orders. We think we would need to store:

- An order number, to keep track of each order internally
- All the donuts in the order
- The customer who placed the order. We suppose we could assume only one customer places any given order.

### Customers
Oh, and we realize it would be lovely to keep track of some information about each of our customers. We‚Äôd love to remember the history of the orders they‚Äôve made. In that case, we think we should store:

- A customer‚Äôs first and last name
- A history of their orders

## Sample Data
Your database should be able to represent‚Ä¶

- Cocoa, for which Union Square Donuts pays $5.00 for one pound.
- Sugar, for which Union Square Donuts pays $2.00 for one pound.
- Union Square Donuts‚Äô ‚ÄúBelgian Dark Chocolate‚Äù donut, which is not gluten-free, costs $4.00, and includes the following ingredients:
    - Cocoa
    - Flour
    - Buttermilk
    - Sugar
- Union Square Donuts‚Äô ‚ÄúBack-To-School Sprinkles‚Äù donut, which is not gluten-free, costs $4.00, and includes the following ingredients:
    - Flour
    - Buttermilk
    - Sugar
    - Sprinkles
- Order 1 from Luis Singh for 3 Belgian Dark Chocolate donuts and 2 Back-To-School Sprinkles donuts.

## Usage
To create a database from your schema, within your `donuts` folder, type

```sql
sqlite3 donuts.db
```

The above will create an empty SQLite database called `donuts.db`.  
Then, in the `sqlite3` prompt, type

```sql
.read schema.sql
```

to read the statements from `schema.sql`.  
Recall you can use `DROP TABLE tablename`, where `tablename` is the name of your table, to delete a table from your database.
