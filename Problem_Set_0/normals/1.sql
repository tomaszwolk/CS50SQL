-- In 1.sql, write a SQL query to find the normal ocean surface temperature in the Gulf of Maine, off the coast of Massachusetts.
-- To find this temperature, look at the data associated with 42.5° of latitude and -69.5° of longitude.
--      * Recall that you can find the normal ocean surface temperature in the 0m column, which stands for 0 meters of depth!

SELECT "0m" FROM "normals"
WHERE "latitude" = 42.5
AND "longitude" = -69.5;
