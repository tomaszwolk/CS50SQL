# From the Deep

In this problem, you'll write freeform responses to the questions provided in the specification.

## Random Partitioning

Partitioning is good because one boat doesn't have enough space to store data, and data will be evenly distributed.
But it will be harder to find data that we need.

## Partitioning by Hour

Data won't be evenly distributed, because most observations are between midnight and 1am.
But it will be easier to find data that we are looking for.

## Partitioning by Hash Value

It's the best option, because it has same benefits as Random Partitioning and it's easier to find specific data. But still for a range of values query have to be run on all of the boats.
